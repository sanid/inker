# Inker v0.6.0

Self-hosted e-ink device management server built for the homelab community. Works with [TRMNL](https://usetrmnl.com/) devices — including the 7.5″ **OG** (800×480, 1-bit) and the 10.3″ **TRMNL X** (1872×1404, 16-level grayscale) — and any BYOD e-ink display. Design screens, create custom widgets with live data from your local network, and manage your displays from a modern web interface.

Inker is heading in its own direction — focusing on homelab integrations like server monitoring, smart home dashboards, network stats, and self-hosted service displays. TRMNL device compatibility is maintained, but the plugin ecosystem will be Inker-native.

## Quick start & Technical information

### Docker Run

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name inker \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 80:80 \
  -v inker_uploads:/app/uploads \
  wojooo/inker:latest
```

### Docker Compose

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  inker:
    image: wojooo/inker:latest
    container_name: inker
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - uploads_data:/app/uploads
    environment:
      TZ: UTC
      ADMIN_PIN: "1111"  # Quotes required — YAML strips leading zeros without them

volumes:
  uploads_data:
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Open **http://your-server-ip** and log in with PIN `1111`.

> **Database:** Inker uses an embedded **SQLite** database stored at `/app/uploads/inker.db` on the `uploads` volume — there's no separate database server to run or manage. Back up the `uploads` volume to back up all your data.

## Configuration

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `ADMIN_PIN` | Login PIN | `1111` |
| `TZ` | Timezone for widgets | `UTC` |
| `INKER_PORT` | External port (for custom port mapping, e.g. `INKER_PORT=800`) | `80` |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | Allowed CORS origins (comma-separated, or `*` for all) | same-origin |

Pass with `-e`:
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name inker \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 80:80 \
  -e ADMIN_PIN="1111" \
  -e TZ=Europe/Warsaw \
  -v inker_uploads:/app/uploads \
  wojooo/inker:latest
```

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/usetrmnl/inker.git
cd inker
docker compose up -d --build
```

## Raspberry Pi / ARM64 (beta)

Inker's Docker image is **multi-architecture** — the same tag runs on both x86-64 servers and 64-bit ARM boards like the Raspberry Pi. Docker automatically pulls the correct build for your hardware, so the install command is identical:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name inker \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 80:80 \
  -v inker_uploads:/app/uploads \
  wojooo/inker:latest
```

**Requirements:**
- A **64-bit** OS (Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit or Debian arm64) — 32-bit installs are **not** supported.
- Raspberry Pi 4 or 5 recommended (screen rendering runs a headless Chromium).

> **Beta:** ARM64 support is new and hasn't been fully verified on every Pi setup yet. If something doesn't work, please [open an issue](https://github.com/usetrmnl/inker/issues) with your Pi model and OS version — feedback is welcome.

## Updating

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

All data (screens, devices, playlists, settings) is preserved — database schema updates are applied automatically on startup.

> **Warning:** Never use `docker compose down -v` to update — the `-v` flag deletes all volumes and you will lose your data.

## Troubleshooting

If something isn't working after an update or on first run, reset the volumes and start fresh:

```bash
docker compose down -v
docker compose up -d
```

> **Note:** This removes all data (database, uploads). Only use on a fresh install or when you don't mind losing data.

## Testing

```bash
cd backend && bun test      # 432 tests
cd frontend && bun run test  # 19 tests
```
